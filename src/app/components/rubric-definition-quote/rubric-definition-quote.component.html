                A scoring rubric is an attempt to communicate expectations of quality around a task. In many cases,
                scoring rubrics are used to delineate consistent criteria for grading. Because the criteria are public,
                a scoring rubric allows teachers and students alike to evaluate criteria, which can be complex and
                subjective. A scoring rubric can also provide a basis for self-evaluation, reflection, and peer review.
                It is aimed at accurate and fair assessment, fostering understanding, and indicating a way to proceed
                with subsequent learning/teaching.
